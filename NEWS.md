# version 0.2-5

* GEOS requirement lowered to 3.5.0, which also seems to work; #59.

# version 0.2-4

* require sf >= 0.9-3, and use C API PROJ path setting (to work on CRAN windows binaries)

* update to new GEOS (3.8.0) and PROJ (6.3.1) versions for CRAN windows binary builds

* require GEOS 3.6.0 (required by PostGIS 3.0.0), and add check to configure

# version 0.2-3

* fix configure script to work with ubuntu/bionic and PROJ 4.9.3; #28

# version 0.2-3

* fix configure script to work with PROJ 5.x versions

# version 0.2-2

* adjust to sf >= 0.9-0 new crs representation

* use `st_make_valid` generic from package sf; https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1300

# version 0.2-1

* fix PROJ 5.x installation issue (has proj.h, but shouldn't use it)

# version 0.2-0

* export `lwgeom_make_valid`, to gradually move `st_make_valid` from `lwgeom` to `sf`; https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/989

* constrain argument `crs` in `st_transform_proj` to take one or two character strings

* update to POSTGIS 3.0.0 liblwgeom version

# version 0.1-4

# version 0.1-3
